            <p> In this course, I understood many different aspects of coding, such as javascript HTML and CSS. 
                Because nowadays we rely on them to form a business commercial website, games and browsing. 
                Also, able to identify each language used for making a website. Like HTML, it provides the structure of the page. 
                CSS is known for describing the web page, which includes font, colour layout. 
                As for javascript, it is used to make the page interactive and more of the client-side of the page.

                The concept of the responsive design is a graphic user inferface (GUI) to create 
                content to adjust the different screen size. It also helps to create dynamic changes of
                a website. Example like the user switching the laptop to your mobile, the website will
                automatic switch the resolution, image size, to adjust the screen size of the mobile. In addition,
                there are three main components, which are: Media queries, web browser and website interface. 
                Media queries is support by latest web browser by creating media queries. It can used in
                such way with the connection of the layout of pages. Web browser usually contains a lot of pictures, 
                but in responsive web page it helps to resize the pictures and utilizing CSS to manage their 
                relative size. As for website interface, since mobile are usually in touchscreen, which requires 
                the size of the interactive elements within interfaces.

                Responsive design can help you resolve alot of problems. It will makes your site mobile-friendly, 
                it will improve the way it looks on devices with larger and smaller screen. It will increase the 
                amount of time and improve the ranking of in search engine. Responsive deisgn need to approach 
                of being driven by the understanding that allow more people to accessing the mobile web and 
                in many markets that smartphone access to the net is much greater than traditional PC access, since
                many people owns it. Having the site consistent and optimized on whatever platform that you using to 
                view it from, will provided a better experience to the user to lead them to engage with customers
                before deciding to go elsewhere. Also, when you optimize the site whemeverthe end user decides to view 
                it,it make their life easier. Where happy customers makes for happy business for the web.

                The two major device platform for using a web app. Such as IOS and Android. IOS using swift to run a program, 
                like safari. Its the same as google chrome, internet explorer, to search like them by using the search engine,
                google to search stuff. They were also the first web browser to use the new HTML 5 standard. IOS safari
                can only supported by apple products. As for android, they use java. It is their first official language for 
                Android, but later on it got replace to kotlin. Since, kotlin was only 10 years of the program compare to java 
                whos been used for 26 years. This kotlin newer program helps the Android to boost the productivity and the developer 
                satisfaction and more code safety.
